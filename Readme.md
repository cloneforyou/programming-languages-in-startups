# About

This is an analysis done on two sources:

1. Top 100 YCombinator companies: https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/
2. Top 50 TechStars companies: http://www.techstars.com/companies/

# Original Source

The original data is in startups-list.csv file.
Then it was exported to startups-list.json.

And then for each programming language or framework the results are groupped under folder results.

# Thank you

A special thanks to Adina Tudor who helped me with this research and did the initial work about the lists.

# Disclaimer

Please be adviced that the data is based on the data available on the internet. Only few of the companies published themselves articles describing their stack.
Where this information was missing we tried to infer it from job posts and other sources.

# Contributing to this

This is open for anyone to contribute. The only requirement is to please specify the source of your information so that we can update the file accordingly.
You can do this by adding an URL to the source column in the CSV file.
